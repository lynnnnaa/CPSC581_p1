    <h1 class="fw-light">Dog Socializer</h1>

    <div>
      <p class="content"> By clicking on the Golden Retriever dog’s face, you will hear a randomly picked sound/noise with a visual picture of that sound beside. For example, cats, babies, horns, birds and crowds etc. Wait! why do I need to hear that? That’s not for you. That’s for your little partner :). <br><br>
        This design was made for Steve. Steve is recently taking care of his girlfriend's dog Kira. Kira is scared of noise and will went crazy if she was alone. His girlfriend has to leave Kira to him after she go to work. <br><br>
        As a dog owner, I know how it's important to socialize dogs well. Poorly socialized dogs are sensitive to new things, and are much more likely to form aggression, fear and depression (like Kira). <br><br>
        Ideally, one of the best way to socialize dogs is to take them out, introducing and being exposed to as many as new environment as possible. However, that is becoming extremely difficult during this pandemic. And that’s where comes to my idea of making this button that contains a collection of sounds within human-society. Play it for your dog anytime you want. Dogs will eventually getting used to it. <br><br>
        It’s been a hard time for both us and our lovely dogs/cats. But I hope this alternative way of socializing dogs will get your dog less stressed out and more comfortable and relaxing. <br>
